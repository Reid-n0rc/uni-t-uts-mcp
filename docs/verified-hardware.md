# Verified hardware

What this project has actually been tested against. Anything not listed here is untested.

| Model | Firmware | Interface | Port | Verified |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| UNI-T UTS3036B | V1.04.0040 | LAN, raw SCPI over TCP | 5025 | `*IDN?` returns `UNI-TREND,UTS3036B,<serial>,V1.04.0040` (2026-11-10) |

Notes:
- Queries are newline-terminated. Ports 5024 and 23 gave no response.
- Serial numbers are intentionally not recorded in this repo.
- Documentation basis: the UTS3000B programming manual (see [references.md](references.md)). Per-command hardware verification status will be tracked in [programming-guide.md](programming-guide.md).
- UTS1000B/T and other UTS models are expected to be similar but are not verified.
